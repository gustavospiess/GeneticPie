# GeneticPie

A generic phyton lib for genetic algorithm

### notes

Well, it's not a big deal, just a small project.
But its in development process, and I hope I'll be releasing new versions soon.

### What's OK, What's not (_look the projects_)
 - [x] Line function calculation.
 - [x] We have the documentation until here (but it might change).
 - [X] Generic Implementation (it might change too)
 - [ ] Parable function calculation.
 - [ ] Circle function calculation.
